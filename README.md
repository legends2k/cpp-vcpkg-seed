# C++ executable using CMake + vcpkg

Cross-platform, cross-toolchain C++ project using CMake as meta-build system and
vcpkg as package manager.  Useful as seed to germinate further projects from.

# Tools

Make sure the following tools are installed:

* C++ compiler toolchain
  - **Windows**: VC++ (Visual Studio 2017+), [MinGW][] (GCC on Windows), Clang
  - **Linux**: GCC, Clang
  - **Mac**: Clang (Xcode), GCC
* [CMake][]
* [vcpkg][]

**`cmake` should be in `$PATH` / `%PATH%`**.  Verify if `cmake --version`
displays the version properly.

# Build

Fix `vcpkg`â€™s path in the `cmake` command below to the right location
on your machine.

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/legends2k/cpp-vcpkg-seed

cd cpp-vcpkg-seed

cmake -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=D:\vcpkg\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake

cmake --build build
```

This should build the `seed` executable under `//build`.

## IDE

CMake can generate project/solution files for different IDEs including

* Visual Studio
* QtCreator
* Eclipse
* Sublime Text
* CodeBlocks
* Codelite

Locate project files at `//build` directory after project is built from command
line.  Use `-G` in the `cmake -B` command above to change from default IDE;
refer `cmake --help` for details.

# Dependencies

Project dependencies are listed in `vcpkg.json` manifest.  Add/Remove libraries
as needed. Check [available packages in vcpkg][packages] when doing it.  By
default [fltk][] and [spdlog][] are listed as dependencies for GUI programming
and logging.

``` shell
  "dependencies": [
    "spdlog",
    "fltk"
  ]
```

Refer [vcpkg manifest documentation][] for details.
